## Ember Philosophy and Design

- Focus on ambitious web applications
- More productive out of the box
- Stability without stagnation
- Future web standards foresight



Note:
##### Focus on ambitious web applications
Ember sets out to provide a wholesale solution to the client-side application problem. This is in 
contrast to many JavaScript frameworks that start by providing a solution to the V in MVC 
(Model–View–Controller), and attempt to grow from there.

##### More productive out of the box
Ember is one component of a set of tools that work together to provide a complete development stack. 
The aim of these tools is to make the developer productive immediately. For example **Ember CLI**, 
provides a standard application structure and build pipeline. It also has a **pluggable architecture** 
and over thirty-five hundred addons to enhance and extend it.

##### Stability without stagnation
This is the idea that backward compatibility is important and can be maintained while still innovating 
and evolving the framework.

##### Future web standards foresight
Ember has been an early adopter and pioneer of many standards around JavaScript and the web 
including promises, web components and ES6 syntax. Yehuda Katz, one of Ember's cofounders, 
is a member on TC39, which is the committee responsible for future versions of the JavaScript language.
